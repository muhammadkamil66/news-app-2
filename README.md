-------------

You can see the website here: https://muhammadkamil66.github.io/news-app-2/.

A basic client-side News app example.  
Uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/sources) to request news data.

### Ingredients
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
  * HTML - the information represented on the page
  * CSS - the style or look of the information
  * Javacsript - the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage
  * API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the news data
  * JSON - the news data
  * jQuery - a javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us
